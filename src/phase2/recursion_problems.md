### Problems

1. Rope cut problem.
2. String subset.
3. Josephus problem.
4. Permutation of string. [Hint: Need recursion within loop]
5. Tower of hanoi.
6. Integer Array subset. [Hint: Need backtracking too]
7. Permutation of Int array. [Hint: Need recursion within loop]
8. Letter combination of phone number. [Hint: Its straightforward, recursion within loop and think of recursive call as a nested loop getting executed, also keep in mind of backtracking]
9. Merge sort.
10. Quick Sort. [Hint: Pivot, Partition and swap recursive]
11. Combination Sum I - [Hint: Take/Not take approach with backtracking, keep in mind that new ref of collection to create while adding in solution collection]
12. Combination Sum II - [Hint: For loop pattern of recursion]
