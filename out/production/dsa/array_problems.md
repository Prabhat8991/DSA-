### Imp questions

1. Remove duplicates from array. [Hint: Think if elements not equal then shift left, 2 pointers, unique element ptr points to index which has to be filled with unique element] 
2. Shift all zeroes to end. [Hint: Always keep zero tracking counter intact unless swapped]
3. Left rotate array by D places. [Hint: Try to derive quick formula]
4. Maximum difference problem with order, such that j > i. [Hint: Keep track of minimum from left to right and treat every element as j]
5. Stock Buy sell. [Hint: Surprisingly small solution. Incremental Profits adds up to max profit]
6. Trapping rain water [Hint: Precalculate left max and right max for each element]
7. Maximum Subarray sum. [Hint: Kadane's algo]
8. Minimum group flips required to make array same in a binary array. [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1] [Hint: Always flip second group]
9. Stock buy sell with max profit but only one buy and sell allowed. [Hint: Sliding window]
10. Insert intervals [Hint: Sort w.r.t first values with newInterval and then find overlaps and fix using two pointer] [Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/description/]
11. 3 Sum problem [Hint: use 3 pointer approach. Two pointers at start and one pointer from end] [Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/]
12. Combination sum [Could not do it in multiple attempts][Hint: Use recursion and backtracking, think about subtracting from target][Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/]
13. Max Area [Hint: Use two pointer left and right and find area][Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/]
14. 3 Sum closest. [Hint: Similar to 3 sum with sum extra value handling logic]
15. Single number in an array where except one all other numbers are in pair. [Hint: Use XOR]
16. Combination sum 2 [Could not do it in first and second attempt][Hint: Use recursion and backtracking]
